# The Howard Homestead — Website v1 (GitHub Pages-ready)

This is a simple static website (HTML/CSS/JS). No build tools required.

## Quick preview (no hosting)
Just open `index.html` in your browser and click around.

## Deploy to GitHub Pages (no paid hosting needed)
1. Create a GitHub account (if you don’t have one).
2. Create a new repository named: `howard-homestead-site` (or any name you want).
3. Upload **all files** in this folder to the repository root.
4. In GitHub: Settings → Pages
   - Source: Deploy from a branch
   - Branch: `main` (root)
5. GitHub will give you a public URL.

## Edit the important placeholders
Search the files for these placeholders and replace:
- `BAKERY_LINK_PLACEHOLDER`  → Desiree’s bakery website URL
- `FORM_ENDPOINT_PLACEHOLDER` → the endpoint for Goods + Contracting forms (Formspree works well)
- `NEWSLETTER_ENDPOINT_PLACEHOLDER` → the endpoint for newsletter signup

## Next version ideas (easy upgrades)
- Add a true inventory grid (with prices, availability, photos)
- Add a “Mailboxes & Address Signs” service section
- Add SEO + local service area map
- Add online checkout later (Shopify buy button, Stripe payment link, etc.)
